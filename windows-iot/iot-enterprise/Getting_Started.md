# Getting Started with Windows IoT Enterprise
This article will give you an overview of the product and guide you through how to get started with Windows IoT Enterprise.

## What is Windows IoT Enterprise?
Windows IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows Enterprise that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. Windows IoT Enterprise shares all the benefits of the worldwide Windows ecosystem. It is a binary equivalent to Windows Enterprise, so you can use the same familiar development and management tools as client PCs and laptops. However, when it comes to *licensing and distribution*, the desktop version and IoT versions differ. Today there are two releases of Windows IoT Enterprise: [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](/windows/iot/product-family/what's-new-in-windows-10-iot-enterprise-21h2) and [Windows 11 IoT Enterprise](/windows/iot/product-family/what's-new-in-windows-11-iot-enterprise).


> [!NOTE]
>
> Windows 10 IoT Enterprise offers *both* Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) and General Availability Channel (GAC) options, and OEMs can choose the one they need for their devices. At this time Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is only available as an [annual release](/lifecycle/faq/windows#windows-11). For more information on how to reach out to a [Windows IoT Distributor](https://aka.ms/IoTDistributorList) or how to purchase a license, review [Licensing & Usage](./Commercialization/Licensing.md).


## Why Do Customer Choose Windows IoT Enterprise?
There are three main reasons why customers choose to develop with Windows IoT Enterprise:

1. **Productive** - Leverage existing knowledge to build and manage Windows IoT Enterprise devices with powerful tools and technologies to quickly unlock data and drive digital transformation.
2. **Trusted** - Windows IoT Enterprise helps you build IoT solutions that you can trust, keeping your devices, data, and identities secure and giving you peace of mind.
3. **Smart** - Windows IoT Enterprise helps you connect your devices to each other, your network, and the cloud, so you can use data to drive real business insight and create new business opportunities

> [!TIP]
>
> If you are building any kind of **OEM style appliance**, such as a point-of-sale or retail device, industrial automation equipment, digital signage, medical equipment or any appliance with a screen, Windows IoT Enterprise is the solution for you.
